      Two models (Claude / Codex) independently answered the same instruction.
      Synthesize their responses.

      **Tasks:**
      1. Read reports in the Report Directory
         - `01-claude.md` (Claude's response)
         - `02-codex.md` (Codex's response)
         Note: If one report is missing (model failed), synthesize from the available report only
      2. If both reports exist, compare and clarify:
         - Points of agreement
         - Points of disagreement
         - Points mentioned by only one model
      3. Produce a synthesized conclusion

      **Output format:**
      ```markdown
      # Multi-Model Review Synthesis

      ## Conclusion
      {Synthesized conclusion}

      ## Response Status
      | Model | Status |
      |-------|--------|
      | Claude | ✅ / ❌ |
      | Codex | ✅ / ❌ |

      ## Agreements
      - {Points where both models agree}

      ## Disagreements
      | Topic | Claude | Codex |
      |-------|--------|-------|
      | {topic} | {Claude's view} | {Codex's view} |

      ## Unique Findings
      - **Claude only:** {Points only Claude mentioned}
      - **Codex only:** {Points only Codex mentioned}

      ## Overall Assessment
      {Overall assessment considering both responses}
      ```
