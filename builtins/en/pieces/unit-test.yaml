        The ai_review ↔ ai_fix loop has repeated {cycle_count} times.

        Review the reports from each cycle and determine whether this loop
        is healthy (making progress) or unproductive (repeating the same issues).

        **Reports to reference:**
        - AI Review results: {report:04-ai-review.md}

        **Judgment criteria:**
        - Are new issues being found/fixed in each cycle?
        - Are the same findings being repeated?
        - Are fixes actually being applied?

        - condition: Healthy (making progress)
          next: ai_review
        - condition: Unproductive (no improvement)
