Analyze the task and formulate an implementation plan including design decisions.

**Note:** If a Previous Response exists, this is a replan due to rejection.
Revise the plan taking that feedback into account.

**Criteria for small tasks:**
- Only 1-2 file changes
- No design decisions needed
- No technology selection needed

For small tasks, skip the design sections in the report.

**Actions:**
1. Understand the task requirements
   - **When reference material points to an external implementation, determine whether it is a "bug fix clue" or a "design approach to adopt". If narrowing scope beyond the reference material's intent, include the rationale in the plan report**
   - **For each requirement, determine "change needed / not needed". If "not needed", cite the relevant code (file:line) as evidence. Claiming "already correct" without evidence is prohibited**
2. Investigate code to resolve unknowns
3. Identify the impact area
4. Determine file structure and design patterns (if needed)
5. Decide on the implementation approach
   - Verify the implementation approach does not violate knowledge/policy constraints
