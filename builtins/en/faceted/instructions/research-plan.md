Analyze the research request and create a research plan.

**Note:** If Previous Response exists, this is a re-plan from Supervisor feedback.
Incorporate the feedback into the revised plan.

**What to do:**
1. Decompose the request (What: what to know / Why: why / Scope: how far)
2. Identify research items (choose appropriate perspectives based on the type of request)
3. Identify candidate data sources for each item
4. Assign priorities (P1: Required / P2: Important / P3: Nice to have)
