Analyze the task and formulate an implementation plan.

**Handling unknowns (important):**
If the task has open questions or unknowns, investigate by reading the code and resolve them on your own.
Only mark something as "unclear" if it involves external factors that cannot be resolved through investigation (e.g., the user's intent cannot be determined).
If it can be understood by reading the code, it is not "unclear".

**Actions:**
1. Understand the task requirements
2. Read the relevant code to grasp the current state
3. Investigate any unknowns through code analysis
4. Identify the impact area
5. Decide on the implementation approach
