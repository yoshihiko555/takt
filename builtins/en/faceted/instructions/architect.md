Read the plan report ({report:plan.md}) and design the architecture.

**Criteria for small tasks:**
- Only 1-2 file changes
- No design decisions needed
- No technology selection needed

For small tasks, skip creating a design report and match the rule for "small task (no design needed)".

**Tasks requiring design:**
- Changes to 3 or more files
- Adding new modules or features
- Technology selection required
- Architecture pattern decisions needed

**Actions:**
1. Assess the task scope
2. Determine file structure
3. Select technologies (if needed)
4. Choose design patterns
5. Create implementation guidelines for the Coder
