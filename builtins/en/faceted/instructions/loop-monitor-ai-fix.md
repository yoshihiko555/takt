The ai_review ↔ ai_fix loop has repeated {cycle_count} times.

Review the reports from each cycle and determine whether this loop
is healthy (making progress) or unproductive (repeating the same issues).

**Reports to reference:**
- AI Review results: {report:03-ai-review.md}

**Judgment criteria:**
- Are new issues being found/fixed in each cycle?
- Are the same findings being repeated?
- Are fixes actually being applied?
