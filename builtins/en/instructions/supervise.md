Run tests, verify the build, and perform final approval.

**Overall piece verification:**
1. Whether the plan and implementation results are consistent
2. Whether findings from each review movement have been addressed
3. Whether each task spec requirement has been achieved
   - Do not rely on the plan report's judgment; independently verify each requirement against actual code (file:line)

**Report verification:** Read all reports in the Report Directory and
check for any unaddressed improvement suggestions.
