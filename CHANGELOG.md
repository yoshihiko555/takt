## [0.3.8] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- CLI option to specify workflow/config file paths: `--workflow <path>` and `--config <path>` (#81)

### Fixed

  - Issue参照時は `resolveIssueTask` の結果をそのままタスクとして使用するように変更

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- Interactive task planning mode: `takt` (no args) starts AI conversation to refine task requirements before execution (#47, #5)
  - Session persistence across takt restarts
  - Read-only tools (Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch) for codebase investigation
  - Planning-only system prompt prevents code changes during conversation
  - `/go` to confirm and execute, `/cancel` to exit
- Boy Scout Rule enforcement in reviewer/supervisor agent templates

### Changed

- CLI migrated from slash commands (`takt /run-tasks`) to subcommands (`takt run`) (#47)
- `/help` and `/refresh-builtin` commands removed; `eject` simplified
- SDK options builder only includes defined values to prevent hangs

### Fixed

- Claude Agent SDK hanging when `model: undefined` or other undefined options were passed as keys

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- Rule-based workflow transitions with 5-stage fallback evaluation (#30)
  - Tag-based conditions: agent outputs `[STEP:N]` tags matched by index
  - `ai()` conditions: AI evaluates free-text conditions against agent output (#9)
  - `all()`/`any()` aggregate conditions for parallel step results (#20)
  - 5-stage evaluation order: aggregate → Phase 3 tag → Phase 1 tag → AI judge → AI fallback
- 3-phase step execution model (#33)
  - Phase 1: Main work (coding, review, etc.)
  - Phase 2: Report output (when `step.report` defined)
  - Phase 3: Status judgment (when tag-based rules exist)
  - Session resumed across phases for context continuity
- Parallel step execution with concurrent sub-steps via `Promise.all()` (#20)
- GitHub Issue integration: execute/add tasks by issue number, e.g. `takt #6` (#10, #34)
- NDJSON session logging with real-time streaming writes (#27, #36)
- Builtin resources embedded in npm package with `/eject` command for customization (#4, #40)
- `edit` property for per-step file edit control
- Rule match method visualization and logging
- Report output auto-generation from YAML `report.format`
- Parallel review support in builtin workflows with spec compliance checking (#31)
- WorkflowEngine mock integration tests (#17, #41)

### Changed

### Fixed

- Report directory correctly includes `.takt/reports/` prefix (#37, #42)

### Added

- `/list-tasks` command for branch management (try merge, merge & cleanup, delete)

### Changed

- Isolated execution migrated from `git worktree` to `git clone --shared` to prevent Claude Code SDK from traversing back to main repository
- Clone lifecycle: auto-deletion after task completion removed; use `/list-tasks` for cleanup
- `worktree.ts` split into `clone.ts` + `branchReview.ts`
- Origin remote removed from clones to block SDK traversal
