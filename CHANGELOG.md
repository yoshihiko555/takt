# Changelog

[日本語](./docs/CHANGELOG.ja.md)

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.20.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- Pin `@opencode-ai/sdk` to `<1.2.7` to fix broken v2 exports that caused `Cannot find module` errors on `npm install -g takt` (#329)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Faceted Prompting module** (`src/faceted-prompting/`): Standalone library for facet composition, resolution, template rendering, and truncation — zero dependencies on TAKT internals. Includes `DataEngine` interface with `FileDataEngine` and `CompositeDataEngine` implementations for pluggable facet storage
- **Analytics module** (`src/features/analytics/`): Local-only review quality metrics collection — event types (review findings, fix actions, movement results), JSONL writer with date-based rotation, report parser, and metrics computation
- **`takt metrics review` command**: Display review quality metrics (re-report counts, round-trip ratio, resolution iterations, REJECT counts by rule, rebuttal resolution ratio) with configurable time window (`--since`)
- **`takt purge` command**: Purge old analytics event files with configurable retention period (`--retention-days`)
- **`takt reset config` command**: Reset global config to builtin template with automatic backup of the existing config
- **PR duplicate prevention**: When a PR already exists for the current branch, push and comment on the existing PR instead of creating a duplicate (#304)
- Retry mode now positions the cursor on the failed movement when selecting which movement to retry
- E2E tests for run-recovery and config-priority scenarios

### Changed

- **README overhaul**: Compressed from ~950 lines to ~270 lines — details split into dedicated docs (`docs/configuration.md`, `docs/cli-reference.md`, `docs/task-management.md`, `docs/ci-cd.md`, `docs/builtin-catalog.md`) with Japanese equivalents. Redefined product concept around 4 value axes: batteries included, practical, reproducible, multi-agent
- **Config system refactored**: Unified configuration resolution to `resolveConfigValue()` and `loadConfig()`, eliminating scattered config access patterns across the codebase
- **`takt config` command removed**: Replaced by `takt reset config` for resetting to defaults
- Builtin config templates refreshed with updated comments and structure
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` updated to v0.2.47
- Instruct mode prompt improvements for task re-instruction

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where builtin piece file references used absolute path instead of relative (#304)
- Removed unused imports and variables across multiple files

### Internal

- Unified `loadConfig`, `resolveConfigValue`, piece config resolution, and config priority paths
- Added E2E tests for config priority and run recovery scenarios
- Added `postExecution.test.ts` for PR creation flow testing
- Cleaned up unused imports and variables

## [0.19.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Dedicated retry mode for failed tasks — conversation loop with failure context (error details, failed movement, last message), run session data, and piece structure injected into the system prompt
- Dedicated instruct system prompt for completed/failed task re-instruction — injects task name, content, branch changes, and retry notes directly into the prompt instead of using the generic interactive prompt
- Direct re-execution from `takt list` — "execute" action now runs the task immediately in the existing worktree instead of only requeuing to pending
- `startReExecution` atomic task transition — moves a completed/failed task directly to running status, avoiding the requeue → claim race condition
- Worktree reuse in task execution — reuses existing clone directory when it's still on disk, skipping branch name generation and clone creation
- Task history injection into interactive and summary system prompts — completed/failed/interrupted task summaries are included for context
- Previous run reference support in interactive and instruct system prompts — users can reference logs and reports from prior runs
- `findRunForTask` and `getRunPaths` helpers for automatic run session lookup by task content
- `isStaleRunningTask` process helper extracted from TaskLifecycleService for reuse

### Changed

- Interactive module split: `interactive.ts` refactored into `interactive-summary.ts`, `runSelector.ts`, `runSessionReader.ts`, and `selectorUtils.ts` for better cohesion
- `requeueTask` now accepts generic `allowedStatuses` parameter instead of only accepting `failed` tasks
- Instruct/retry actions in `takt list` use the worktree path for conversation and run data lookup instead of the project root
- `save_task` action now requeues the task (saves for later execution), while `execute` action runs immediately

### Internal

- Removed `DebugConfig` from models, schemas, and global config — simplified to verbose mode only
- Added stdin simulation test helpers (`stdinSimulator.ts`) for E2E conversation loop testing
- Added comprehensive E2E tests for retry mode, interactive routes, and run session injection
- Added `check:release` npm script for pre-release validation

## [0.18.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Added `codex_cli_path` global config option and `TAKT_CODEX_CLI_PATH` environment variable to override the Codex CLI binary path used by the Codex SDK (#292)
  - Supports strict validation: absolute path, file existence, executable permission, no control characters
  - Priority: `TAKT_CODEX_CLI_PATH` env var > `codex_cli_path` in config.yaml > SDK vendored binary

## [0.18.1] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Added multi-tenant data isolation section and authorization-resolver consistency code examples to security knowledge
- Added "prefer project scripts" rule to coding policy — detects direct tool invocation (e.g., `npx vitest`) when equivalent npm scripts exist

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **`deep-research` builtin piece**: Multi-angle research workflow with four steps — plan, deep-dive, analyze, and synthesize
- Project-level `.takt/` facets (pieces, personas, policies, knowledge, instructions, output-contracts) are now version-controllable (#286)
- New research facets added: research policy, knowledge, comparative-analysis knowledge, dedicated persona, and instructions

### Changed

- Refactored the `research` piece — separated rules and knowledge embedded in the persona into policy, knowledge, and instruction files, conforming to the faceted design
- Added knowledge/policy references to existing pieces (expert, expert-cqrs, backend, backend-cqrs, frontend)

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where facet directories were not tracked because `.takt/` path prefix was written with `.takt/` prefix in the `.takt/.gitignore` template (dotgitignore)

### Internal

- Created knowledge facet style guide (`KNOWLEDGE_STYLE_GUIDE.md`)
- Added regression tests for dotgitignore patterns

## [0.17.3] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- Added API client generation consistency rules to builtin AI anti-pattern policy and frontend knowledge — detects handwritten clients mixed into projects where generation tools (e.g., Orval) exist

### Fixed

- Fixed EPERM crash when releasing task store locks — replaced file-based locking with in-memory guard

### Internal

- Unified vitest configuration for e2e tests and added `forceExit` option to prevent zombie workers

## [0.17.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **`expert-mini` and `expert-cqrs-mini` pieces**: Lightweight variants of Expert pieces — plan → implement → parallel review (AI anti-pattern + supervisor) → fix workflow
- Added new pieces to "Mini" and "Expert" piece categories

### Fixed

- Fixed an error being thrown when permission mode could not be resolved — now falls back to `readonly`

## [0.17.1] - 2026-02-15

### Changed

- Changed `.takt/.gitignore` template to allowlist approach — ignores all files by default and tracks only `config.yaml`. Prevents ignore gaps when new files are added

## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Mini piece series**: Added `default-mini`, `frontend-mini`, `backend-mini`, `backend-cqrs-mini` — lightweight development pieces with parallel review (AI anti-pattern + supervisor) as successors to `coding`/`minimal`
- Added "Mini" category to piece categories
- **`supervisor-validation` output contract**: Requirements Fulfillment Check table format that presents code evidence per requirement
- **`getJudgmentReportFiles()`**: Phase 3 status judgment target reports can now be filtered via `use_judge` flag
- Added `finding_id` tracking to output contracts (new/persists/resolved sections for tracking findings across iterations)

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Removed `coding` and `minimal` pieces** — replaced by the mini piece series. Migration: `coding` → `default-mini`, `minimal` → `default-mini`
- **BREAKING: Unified output contract to item format** — `use_judge` (boolean) and `format` (string) fields are now required; `OutputContractLabelPath` (label:path format) is removed
- Moved runtime environment directory from `.runtime` to `.takt/.runtime`
- Enhanced supervisor requirements verification: extracts requirements individually and verifies one-by-one against code (file:line) — "roughly complete" is no longer valid grounds for APPROVE

### Fixed

- Added retry mechanism for deleting clone/worktree directories (`maxRetries: 3`, `retryDelay: 200`) — reduces transient deletion failures caused by file locks

### Internal

- Removed `review-summary` output contract (consolidated into `supervisor-validation`)
- Updated all builtin pieces, e2e fixtures, and tests to the new output contract format

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Provider-specific permission profiles (`provider_profiles`)**: Define default permission modes per provider and per-movement overrides in global (`~/.takt/config.yaml`) and project (`.takt/config.yaml`) config — 5-level priority resolution (project override → global override → project default → global default → `required_permission_mode` floor)

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `permission_mode` → `required_permission_mode`**: Renamed movement's `permission_mode` field to `required_permission_mode` — acts as a floor value; the actual permission mode is resolved via `provider_profiles`. Old `permission_mode` is rejected by `z.never()`, no backward compatibility
- Rewrote builtin `config.yaml` template: reorganized comments, added `provider_profiles` description and examples, added OpenCode-related settings

### Internal

- Added tests for provider profile resolution (global-provider-profiles, project-provider-profiles, permission-profile-resolution, options-builder)
- Added missing `loadProjectConfig` mock to parallel execution tests

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Runtime environment presets**: `piece_config.runtime.prepare` and global config `runtime.prepare` allow environment preparation scripts to run automatically before piece execution — builtin presets (`gradle`, `node`) isolate dependency resolution and cache setup to the `.runtime/` directory
- **Loop monitor judge instruction**: `loop_monitors` judge config now supports `instruction_template` field — externalizes loop judgment instructions as an instruction facet, applied to builtin pieces (expert, expert-cqrs)

### Internal

- Added runtime environment tests (runtime-environment, globalConfig-defaults, models, provider-options-piece-parser)
- Added provider e2e test (runtime-config-provider)

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **`takt list` instruct mode (#267)**: Added instruct mode for issuing additional instructions to existing branches — refine requirements through a conversation loop before piece execution
- **`takt list` completed task actions (#271)**: Added diff view and branch operations (merge, delete) for completed tasks
- **Claude sandbox configuration**: `provider_options.claude.sandbox` supports `excluded_commands` and `allow_unsandboxed_commands`
- **`provider_options` global/project config**: `provider_options` can now be set in `~/.takt/config.yaml` (global) and `.takt/config.yaml` (project) — acts as lowest-priority fallback for piece-level settings

### Changed

- **Consolidated provider/model resolution into AgentRunner**: Fixed provider resolution to prioritize project config over custom agent config. Added step-level `stepModel`/`stepProvider` overrides
- **Unified post-execution flow**: Shared `postExecution.ts` for interactive mode and instruct mode (auto-commit, push, PR creation)
- **Added scope-narrowing prevention to instructions**: plan, ai-review, and supervise instructions now require detecting missed requirements — plan mandates per-requirement "change needed/not needed" judgments with rationale, supervise prohibits blindly trusting plan reports

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where interactive mode options were displayed during async execution (#266)
- Fixed OpenCode session ID not being carried over during parallel execution — server singleton prevents race conditions in parallel runs
- Extended OpenCode SDK server startup timeout from 30 seconds to 60 seconds

### Internal

- Large-scale task management refactor: split `TaskRunner` responsibilities into `TaskLifecycleService`, `TaskDeletionService`, and `TaskQueryService`
- Split `taskActions.ts` by feature: `taskBranchLifecycleActions.ts`, `taskDiffActions.ts`, `taskInstructionActions.ts`, `taskDeleteActions.ts`
- Added `postExecution.ts`, `taskResultHandler.ts`, `instructMode.ts`, `taskActionTarget.ts`
- Consolidated piece selection logic into `pieceSelection/index.ts` (extracted from `selectAndExecute.ts`)
- Added/expanded tests: instructMode, listNonInteractive-completedActions, listTasksInteractiveStatusActions, option-resolution-order, taskInstructionActions, selectAndExecute-autoPr, etc.
- Added Claude Code sandbox option (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox`) to E2E tests
- Added `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` to `.gitignore`

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **Team Leader movement**: New movement type where a team leader agent dynamically decomposes a task into sub-tasks (Parts) and executes multiple part agents in parallel — supports `team_leader` config (persona, maxParts, timeoutMs, partPersona, partEdit, partPermissionMode) (#244)
- **Structured Output**: Introduced JSON Schema-based structured output for agent calls — three schemas for task decomposition, rule evaluation, and status judgment added to `builtins/schemas/`. Supported by both Claude and Codex providers (#257)
- **`provider_options` piece-level config**: Provider-specific options (`codex.network_access`, `opencode.network_access`) can now be set at piece level (`piece_config.provider_options`) and individual movements — Codex/OpenCode network access enabled in all builtin pieces
- **`backend` builtin piece**: New backend development piece — parallel specialist review by backend, security, and QA reviewers
- **`backend-cqrs` builtin piece**: New CQRS+ES backend development piece — parallel specialist review by CQRS+ES, security, and QA reviewers
- **AbortSignal for part timeouts**: Added timeout control and parent signal propagation via AbortSignal for Team Leader part execution
- **Agent usecase layer**: `agent-usecases.ts` consolidates agent call usecases (`decomposeTask`, `executeAgent`, `evaluateRules`) and centralizes structured output injection

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Public API cleanup**: Significantly narrowed the public API in `src/index.ts` — internal implementation details (session management, Claude/Codex client internals, utility functions, etc.) are no longer exported, reducing the API surface to a stable minimum (#257)
- **Revamped Phase 3 judgment logic**: Removed `JudgmentDetector`/`FallbackStrategy` and consolidated into `status-judgment-phase.ts` with structured output-based judgment. Improves stability and maintainability (#257)
- **Report phase retry improvement**: Report Phase (Phase 2) now automatically retries with a new session when it fails (#245)
- **Unified Ctrl+C shutdown**: Removed `sigintHandler.ts` and consolidated into `ShutdownManager` — graceful shutdown → timeout → force-kill in three stages, unified across all providers (#237)
- **Scope-deletion guardrails**: Added rules to coder persona prohibiting deletions and structural changes outside the task instruction scope. Added scope discipline and reference material priority rules to planner persona
- Added design token and theme scope guidance to frontend knowledge
- Improved architecture knowledge (both en/ja)

### Fixed

- Fixed checkout failure for existing branches during clone — now passes `--branch` to `git clone --shared` then removes the remote
- Removed `#` from issue-referenced branch names (`takt/#N/slug` → `takt/N/slug`)
- Resolved deprecated tool dependency in OpenCode report phase; migrated to permission-based control (#246)
- Removed unnecessary exports to ensure public API consistency

### Internal

- Added Team Leader tests (engine-team-leader, team-leader-schema-loader, task-decomposer)

- Added unit tests for public API exports (public-api-exports)
- Added tests for provider_options (provider-options-piece-parser, models, opencode-types)
- Significantly expanded E2E tests: cycle-detection, model-override, multi-step-sequential, pipeline-local-repo, report-file-output, run-sigint-graceful, session-log, structured-output, task-status-persistence
- Refactored E2E test helpers (extracted shared setup functions)
- Removed `judgment/` directory (JudgmentDetector, FallbackStrategy)
- Added `ruleIndex.ts` utility (1-based → 0-based index conversion)

## [0.12.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- Fixed silent fallthrough to a new session when the session was not found — now shows an info message when no session is detected

### Internal

- Set OpenCode provider report phase to deny (prevents unnecessary writes in Phase 2)
- Skip copying `tasks/` directory during project initialization (TASK-FORMAT is no longer needed)
- Added stream diagnostics utility (`streamDiagnostics.ts`)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **OpenCode provider**: Native support for OpenCode as a third provider — SDK integration via `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2`, permission mapping (readonly/edit/full → reject/once/always), SSE stream handling, retry mechanism (up to 3 times), and hang detection with 10-minute timeout (#236, #238)
- **Arpeggio movement**: New movement type for data-driven batch processing — CSV data source with batch splitting, template expansion (`{line:N}`, `{col:N:name}`, `{batch_index}`), concurrent LLM calls (Semaphore-controlled), and concat/custom merge strategies (#200)
- **`frontend` builtin piece**: Frontend development piece — React/Next.js knowledge injection, coding/testing policy, parallel architecture review
- **Slack Webhook notifications**: Automatic Slack notification on piece completion — configured via `TAKT_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK` env var, 10-second timeout, non-blocking on failure (#234)
- **Session selector UI**: On interactive mode startup, select a resumable session from past Claude Code sessions — shows latest 10 sessions with initial input and last response preview (#180)
- **Provider event logs**: Claude/Codex/OpenCode execution events written to NDJSON files — `.takt/logs/{sessionId}-provider-events.jsonl`, with automatic compression of large text (#236)
- **Provider/model name display**: Active provider and model name shown in console output at each movement execution

### Changed

- **Revamped `takt add`**: Auto-add to task on issue selection, removed interactive mode, added task stacking confirmation on issue creation (#193, #194)
- **`max_iteration` → `max_movement` unification**: Unified terminology for iteration limits; added `ostinato` for unlimited execution (#212)
- **Improved `previous_response` injection**: Implemented length control and always-inject Source Path (#207)
- **Task management improvements**: Redefined `.takt/tasks/` as storage for long-form task specs; `completeTask()` removes completed records from `tasks.yaml` (#201, #204)
- **Improved review output**: Updated review output format; moved past reports to history log (#209)
- **Simplified builtin pieces**: Further streamlined top-level declarations across all builtin pieces

### Fixed

- **Fixed Report Phase blocked behavior**: Report Phase (Phase 2) now retries with a new session when blocked (#163)
- **Fixed OpenCode hang and termination detection**: Suppressed prompt echo, suppressed question prompts, fixed hang issues, corrected termination detection (#238)
- **Fixed OpenCode permission and tool wiring**: Corrected permission and tool wiring during edit execution
- **Worktree task spec copy**: Fixed task spec not being correctly copied during worktree execution
- Fixed lint errors (merge/resolveTask/confirm)

### Internal

## [0.11.1] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- Fixed AI Judge to route through provider system — changed `callAiJudge` from a Claude-only implementation to provider-based (`runAgent`), enabling correct AI judgment with the Codex provider
- Reduced instruction bloat — set `pass_previous_response: false` in implement/fix movements, prioritizing reports in the Report Directory as primary information source (en/ja)

### Internal

- Improved CI workflow to automatically sync npm `next` dist-tag to `latest` on stable releases (with retry)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **`e2e-test` builtin piece**: E2E test focused piece — E2E analysis → E2E implementation → review → fix flow (for Vitest-based E2E tests)
- **`error` status**: Separated provider errors from `blocked`, enabling clear distinction of error states. Added retry mechanism to Codex

- **Strengthened loop prevention policy**: Enhanced policy to prevent agent infinite loops

### Fixed

- Fixed original instruction diff processing not working correctly (#181)
- Fixed task spec goal being inappropriately scope-expanded — goal is now always fixed to implementation and execution

### Internal

- Large-scale task management refactor: removed `parser.ts` and split into `store.ts`/`mapper.ts`/`schema.ts`/`naming.ts`. Split branch resolution into `branchGitResolver.ts`/`branchBaseCandidateResolver.ts`/`branchBaseRefCache.ts`/`branchEntryPointResolver.ts`

- Refactored Codex client
- Improved facet resolution logic in piece parser

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **`structural-reform` builtin piece**: Full project review and structural reform — iterative codebase restructuring with staged file splits, powered by `loop_monitors`
- **`unit-test` builtin piece**: Unit test focused piece — test analysis → test implementation → review → fix, with `loop_monitors` for cycle control
- **`test-planner` persona**: Specialized persona for analyzing codebase and planning comprehensive test strategies
- **Interactive mode variants**: Four selectable modes after piece selection — `assistant` (default: AI-guided requirement refinement), `persona` (conversation with first movement's persona), `quiet` (generate instructions without questions), `passthrough` (user input used as-is)
- **`persona_providers` config**: Per-persona provider overrides (e.g., `{ coder: 'codex' }`) — route specific personas to different providers without creating hybrid pieces
- **`task_poll_interval_ms` config**: Configurable polling interval for `takt run` to detect new tasks during execution (default: 500ms, range: 100–5000ms)
- **`interactive_mode` piece field**: Piece-level default interactive mode override (e.g., set `passthrough` for pieces that don't benefit from AI planning)
- **Task-level output prefixing**: Colored `[taskName]` prefix on all output lines during parallel `takt run` execution, preventing mid-line interleaving between concurrent tasks
- **Review policy facet**: Shared review policy (`builtins/{lang}/policies/review.md`) for consistent review criteria across pieces

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Removed all Hybrid Codex pieces (`*-hybrid-codex`) — replaced by `persona_providers` config which achieves the same result without duplicating piece files
- Removed `tools/generate-hybrid-codex.mjs` (no longer needed with `persona_providers`)
- Improved parallel execution output: movement-level prefix now includes task context and iteration info in concurrent runs
- Codex client now detects stream hangs (10-minute idle timeout) and distinguishes timeout vs external abort in error messages
- Parallel task execution (`takt run`) now polls for newly added tasks during execution instead of only checking between task completions
- Parallel task execution no longer enforces per-task time limits (previously had a timeout)
- Issue references now routed through interactive mode (as initial input) instead of skipping interactive mode entirely
- Builtin `config.yaml` updated to document all GlobalConfig fields
- Extracted `conversationLoop.ts` for shared conversation logic across interactive mode variants
- Line editor improvements: additional key bindings and edge case fixes

### Fixed

- Codex processes hanging indefinitely when stream becomes idle — now aborted after 10 minutes of inactivity, releasing worker pool slots

### Internal

- New test coverage: engine-persona-providers, interactive-mode (532 lines), task-prefix-writer, workerPool expansion, pieceResolver expansion, lineEditor expansion, parallel-logger expansion, globalConfig-defaults expansion, pieceExecution-debug-prompts expansion, it-piece-loader expansion, runAllTasks-concurrency expansion, engine-parallel
- Extracted `TaskPrefixWriter` for task-level parallel output management
- Extracted `modeSelection.ts`, `passthroughMode.ts`, `personaMode.ts`, `quietMode.ts` from interactive module
- `InteractiveMode` type model added (`src/core/models/interactive-mode.ts`)
- `PieceEngine` validates `taskPrefix`/`taskColorIndex` pair consistency at construction
- Implementation notes document added (`docs/implements/retry-and-session.ja.md`)

### Added

- **`takt catalog` command**: List available facets (personas, policies, knowledge, instructions, output-contracts) across layers (builtin/user/project)
- **`compound-eye` builtin piece**: Multi-model review — sends the same instruction to Claude and Codex simultaneously, then synthesizes both responses

- **Rich line editor in interactive mode**: Shift+Enter for multiline input, cursor movement (arrow keys, Home/End), Option+Arrow word movement, Ctrl+A/E/K/U/W editing, paste bracket mode support
- **Movement preview in interactive mode**: Injects piece movement structure (persona + instruction) into the AI planner for improved task analysis (`interactive_preview_movements` config, default: 3)
- **MCP server configuration**: Per-movement MCP (Model Context Protocol) server settings with stdio/SSE/HTTP transport support
- **Facet-level eject**: `takt eject persona coder` — eject individual facets by type and name for customization
- **3-layer facet resolution**: Personas, policies, and other facets resolved via project → user → builtin lookup (name-based references supported)
- **`pr-commenter` persona**: Specialized persona for posting review findings as GitHub PR comments
- **`notification_sound` config**: Enable/disable notification sounds (default: true)
- **Prompt log viewer**: `tools/prompt-log-viewer.html` for visualizing prompt-response pairs during debugging
- Auto-PR base branch now set to the current branch before branch creation

### Changed

- Replaced readline with raw-mode line editor in interactive mode (cursor management, inter-line movement, Kitty keyboard protocol)
- Unified interactive mode `save_task` with `takt add` worktree setup flow
- Added `-d` flag to caffeinate to prevent App Nap process freezing during display sleep
- Issue references now routed through interactive mode (previously executed directly, now used as initial input)
- SDK update: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` v0.2.34 → v0.2.37
- Enhanced interactive session scoring prompts with piece structure information

### Internal

Formal release of RC1/RC2 content. No functional changes.

## [0.6.0-rc1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed infinite loop between ai_review and ai_fix: resolved issue where ai_fix judging "no fix needed" caused a return to plan and restarted the full pipeline
