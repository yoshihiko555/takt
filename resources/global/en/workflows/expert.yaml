# Expert Review Workflow
# Review workflow with Architecture, Frontend, Security, and QA experts

# Fix destination is determined by Coder based on change impact:

# - fix_qa: MINOR→qa_review, SECURITY→security_review, MAJOR→architect_review
#
# Template Variables:
#   {iteration}      - Workflow-wide turn count (total steps executed across all agents)
#   {max_iterations} - Maximum iterations allowed for the workflow
#   {step_iteration} - Per-step iteration count (how many times THIS step has been executed)
#   {task}           - Original user request
#   {previous_response} - Output from the previous step
#   {git_diff}       - Current uncommitted changes (git diff)
#   {user_inputs}    - Accumulated user inputs during workflow

      ## User Request
      {task}

      ## Previous Response (when returned from implement)
      {previous_response}

      ## Instructions
      Analyze the task and create an implementation plan.

      review and revise the plan based on that feedback (replan).

      **Tasks:**
      1. Understand the requirements
      2. Identify impact scope
      3. Decide implementation approach

      **Report output:** Output to the `Report File` specified above.
      - If file does not exist: Create new file

      ## Instructions
      **Important**: Fix the issues pointed out by the security expert.
      Security issues should be addressed with highest priority.

      Areas of concern:
      - Injection vulnerabilities
      - Authentication/authorization flaws
      - Sensitive information exposure
      - Encryption issues

      ## Completion: Determine Change Impact
      When fix is complete, judge the **impact scope of changes** and output the appropriate tag:

      - `[CODER:DONE]` - Minor fix (re-run security review only)
        - Examples: Add validation, add escaping, configuration changes
      - `[CODER:REJECT]` - Major fix (restart from Architecture review)
        - Examples: Data flow changes, API design changes, auth method changes, domain model changes

      Include [CODER:BLOCKED] if unable to proceed.
