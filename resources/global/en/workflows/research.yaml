# Research Workflow
# A workflow that autonomously executes research tasks
# Planner creates the plan, Digger executes, Supervisor verifies
#
# Flow:
# plan -> dig -> supervise -> COMPLETE (approved)
#                          -> plan (rejected: restart from planning)
#
# Template Variables:
#   {iteration}      - Workflow-wide turn count (total steps executed across all agents)
#   {max_iterations} - Maximum iterations allowed for the workflow
#   {step_iteration} - Per-step iteration count (how many times THIS step has been executed)
#   {task}           - Original user request
#   {previous_response} - Output from the previous step
#   {user_inputs}    - Accumulated user inputs during workflow
#   {report_dir}     - Report directory name (e.g., "20250126-143052-task-summary")

      - Step: plan

      ## Research Request

      ## Supervisor Feedback (for re-planning)
      {previous_response}

      ## Additional User Inputs
      {user_inputs}

      ## Instructions
      Create a research plan for the above request.

      **Important**: Do not ask the user questions.
      - Make assumptions for unclear points and proceed
      - If multiple interpretations exist, include all in the research scope
      - If there is feedback from Supervisor, incorporate it into the plan

      ## Instructions
      Execute the research according to the plan above.

      **Important**: Do not ask the user questions.
      - Research within the scope of what can be investigated
      - Report items that could not be researched as "Unable to research"

      {previous_response}

      ## Instructions
      Evaluate the research results and determine if they adequately answer the original request.

      **Important**: If there are issues, include specific instructions for the Planner.
