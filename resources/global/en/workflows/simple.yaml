        ### Implementation Approach

      ## Previous Response (when returned from implement)
      {previous_response}

      Analyze the task and create an implementation plan.

      **Note:** If returned from implement step (Previous Response exists),
      review and revise the plan based on that feedback (replan).

      **Tasks (for implementation tasks):**
      1. Understand the requirements
      2. Identify impact scope
      3. Decide implementation approach

      Follow the plan from the plan step and implement.
      Refer to the plan report (00-plan.md) and proceed with implementation.

      ## Task
      {One-line task summary}

      ## Planned Changes
      | Type | File |
      |------|------|
      | Create | `src/example.ts` |
      | Modify | `src/routes.ts` |

      ## Estimated Size
      Small / Medium / Large

      ## Impact Scope
      - {Affected modules or features}
      ```

      **Decisions report format (on completion, only if decisions were made):**
      ```markdown
      # Decision Log

      ## 1. {Decision Content}
      - **Background**: {Why the decision was needed}
      - **Options Considered**: {List of options}
      - **Reason**: {Why this option was chosen}

      **Workflow Overall Review:**
      1. Does the implementation match the plan (00-plan.md)?
      2. Were all review step issues addressed?
      3. Was the original task objective achieved?

      **Review Reports:** Read all reports in Report Directory and
      check for any unaddressed improvement suggestions.
