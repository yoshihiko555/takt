# Simple TAKT Workflow
# Plan -> Coder -> Architect Review -> AI Review -> Supervisor Approval
# (Simplified version of default - removed improve, fix, ai_fix, security_review, security_fix)
#
# Template Variables:
#   {iteration}      - Workflow-wide turn count (total steps executed across all agents)
#   {max_iterations} - Maximum iterations allowed for the workflow
#   {step_iteration} - Per-step iteration count (how many times THIS step has been executed)
#   {task}           - Original user request
#   {previous_response} - Output from the previous step
#   {git_diff}       - Current uncommitted changes (git diff)
#   {user_inputs}    - Accumulated user inputs during workflow
#   {report_dir}     - Report directory name (e.g., "20250126-143052-task-summary")

      ## Judgment Criteria

      | Situation | Judgment |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Requirements clear and implementable | DONE |
      | User is asking a question (not an implementation task) | ANSWER |
      | Requirements unclear, insufficient info | BLOCKED |

      ## Output Format

      | Situation | Tag |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Analysis complete | `[PLANNER:DONE]` |
      | Question answered | `[PLANNER:ANSWER]` |
      | Insufficient info | `[PLANNER:BLOCKED]` |

      ### Output Examples

      **DONE case:**
      ```
      [PLANNER:DONE]
      ```

      **ANSWER case:**
      ```
      {Answer to the question}

      [PLANNER:ANSWER]
      ```

      **BLOCKED case:**
      ```
      [PLANNER:BLOCKED]

      Clarifications needed:
      - {Question 1}
      - {Question 2}

      ## Workflow Context
      - Iteration: {iteration}/{max_iterations} (workflow-wide)
      - Step Iteration: {step_iteration} (times this step has run)
      - Step: plan (Task Analysis)
      - Report Directory: .takt/reports/{report_dir}/
      - Report File: .takt/reports/{report_dir}/00-plan.md

      ## User Request
      {task}

      ## Previous Response (when returned from implement)
      {previous_response}

      ## Instructions
      Analyze the task and create an implementation plan.

      **Judgment criteria:**
      - If the user input is an implementation task → create a plan and output `[PLANNER:DONE]`
      - If the user input is a question → research, answer, and output `[PLANNER:ANSWER]`
      - If there is insufficient information → output `[PLANNER:BLOCKED]`

      **Note:** If returned from implement step (Previous Response exists),
      review and revise the plan based on that feedback (replan).

      **Tasks (for implementation tasks):**
      1. Understand the requirements
      2. Identify impact scope
      3. Decide implementation approach

      **Report output:** Output to the `Report File` specified above.
      - If file does not exist: Create new file
      - If file exists: Append with `## Iteration {step_iteration}` section

      **Report format:**
      ```markdown
      # Task Plan

      ## Original Request
      {User's request as-is}

      ## Analysis Results

      ### Objective
      {What needs to be achieved}

      ### Scope
      {Impact scope}

      ### Implementation Approach
      {How to proceed}

      ## Clarifications Needed (if any)
      - {Unclear points or items requiring confirmation}

      ## Output Format

      | Situation | Tag |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Implementation complete | `[CODER:DONE]` |
      | Cannot decide/insufficient info | `[CODER:BLOCKED]` |

      **Important**: When in doubt, `[BLOCKED]`. Don't decide on your own.

      ### Output Examples

      **DONE case:**
      ```
      Implementation complete.
      - Created: `src/auth/service.ts`, `tests/auth.test.ts`
      - Modified: `src/routes.ts`

      [CODER:DONE]
      ```

      **BLOCKED case:**
      ```
      [CODER:BLOCKED]

      Reason: DB schema is undefined, cannot implement
      Required info: users table structure
      ```

      ## Instructions
      Focus on **architecture and design** review. Do NOT review AI-specific issues (that's the next step).

      Review the changes and provide feedback.

      **Note:** In simple workflow, IMPROVE judgment is not used.
