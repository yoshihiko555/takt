# Agent Guide

This guide explains how to configure and create custom agents in TAKT.

## Built-in Personas

TAKT includes built-in personas (located in `builtins/{lang}/facets/personas/`):

| Persona | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **planner** | Task analysis, spec investigation, and implementation planning |
| **coder** | Implements features and fixes bugs |
| **ai-antipattern-reviewer** | Reviews for AI-specific anti-patterns (hallucinated APIs, incorrect assumptions, scope creep) |
| **architecture-reviewer** | Reviews architecture and code quality, verifies spec compliance |
| **security-reviewer** | Security vulnerability assessment |
| **supervisor** | Final verification, validation, and approval |

## Specifying Personas

In piece YAML, personas are specified via section maps:

```yaml
# Section map at top level (key → file path relative to piece YAML)
personas:
  coder: ../facets/personas/coder.md
  reviewer: ../facets/personas/architecture-reviewer.md

movements:
  - name: implement
    persona: coder       # References the key in section map
  - name: review
    persona: reviewer    # References the key in section map
```

Alternatively, use file paths directly:

```yaml
movements:
  - name: implement
    persona: ../facets/personas/coder.md     # Relative to piece file
  - name: review
    persona: ~/.takt/facets/personas/my-reviewer.md  # User custom
```

## Creating Custom Personas

### Persona Prompt File

Create a Markdown file with your persona's instructions:

```markdown
# Security Reviewer

You are a security-focused code reviewer.

## Your Role
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify input validation
- Review authentication logic

## Guidelines
- Focus on OWASP Top 10 issues
- Check for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- Verify proper error handling
```

> **Note**: Personas do NOT need to output status markers manually. The piece engine auto-injects status output rules into agent instructions based on the movement's `rules` configuration. Agents output `[STEP:N]` tags (where N is the 0-based rule index) which the engine uses for routing.

### Using agents.yaml

For more control, define agents in `.takt/agents.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: my-reviewer
    prompt_file: .takt/prompts/reviewer.md
    allowed_tools:
      - Read
      - Glob
      - Grep
```

### Agent Configuration Options

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Agent identifier (referenced in piece movements) |
| `prompt_file` | Path to Markdown prompt file |
| `prompt` | Inline prompt text (alternative to `prompt_file`) |
| `allowed_tools` | List of tools the agent can use |

### Available Tools

- `Read` — Read files
- `Glob` — Find files by pattern
- `Grep` — Search file contents
- `Edit` — Modify files
- `Write` — Create/overwrite files
- `Bash` — Execute commands
- `WebSearch` — Search the web
- `WebFetch` — Fetch web content

## Best Practices

1. **Clear role definition** — State what the agent does and doesn't do
2. **Minimal tools** — Grant only necessary permissions
3. **Use `edit: false`** — Review agents should not modify files
4. **Focused scope** — One agent, one responsibility
5. **Customize via `/eject`** — Copy builtin personas to `~/.takt/` for modification rather than writing from scratch

## Example: Multi-Reviewer Setup

```yaml
# .takt/agents.yaml
agents:
  - name: performance-reviewer
    prompt_file: .takt/prompts/performance.md
    allowed_tools: [Read, Glob, Grep, Bash]
```

```yaml
# piece.yaml
personas:
  coder: ../facets/personas/coder.md

movements:
  - name: implement
    persona: coder
    edit: true
    rules:
      - condition: Implementation complete
        next: review
      - condition: Cannot proceed
        next: ABORT

  - name: review
    persona: performance-reviewer    # References agents.yaml by name
    edit: false
    rules:
      - condition: Approved
        next: COMPLETE
      - condition: Needs fix
        next: implement
    instruction_template: |
      Review the implementation for performance issues.
```
